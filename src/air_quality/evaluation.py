    Evaluate a model with GroupKFold, holding out one group at a time.

    Generalizes evaluate_manual_split's single train/test pair to every group in
    df: with as many folds as there are distinct values of groups_col, each fold
    leaves one entire group out for validation and trains on the rest — the same
    guarantee (a group's rows never appear in both train and validation) applied
    systematically instead of to a single manually chosen pair.

    Parameters:
    - model: a scikit-learn estimator, following the fit/predict contract; a
      fresh clone() is fitted for each fold so folds cannot leak state into
      one another
    - df: DataFrame containing feature_cols, target_col and groups_col
    - feature_cols: list of column names used as input features
    - groups_col: column identifying each row's group (e.g. "city")
    - target_col: name of the column to predict

    Returns:
    - dict with "folds" (one dict per fold, each with "test_group" and that
      fold's regression metrics) and "rmse_mean"/"rmse_std"/"mae_mean"/
      "mae_std"/"r2_mean"/"r2_std" aggregated across folds
